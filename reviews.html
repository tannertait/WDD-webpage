I could have used some more maps and field guides on the specific areas we were going to....consider expanding your site to include information concerning various rivers throughout the U.S., if not the world. Then you guys would be the premier rafting site, I am so sure.... That said, you really saved us a ton of time, packing and even money with all the amazing tips. Totally recommending you to all my friends!!! Also, would you guys consider updat...<a href=# , id="oddball">Read More....</a></p>

            <p class=textcolor>I have been in love with the river ever since seeing the aptly named movie that is the subject of my review. From that day forward, I set out to be the best fly fisherman the world had ever seen. In the years that followed, my love for the sport expanded to a thrill for the chase and everything comes with it. I love to fish, but I love to get to shose secluded and rich fishing holes almost just as much, and sometimes that just includes raftiung and ending up where the waves take me. There isn't enough information on rivers outside of the Idaho area on this site, and that's what I'm looking for. Consider adding a portion of revi....<a href=#>Read More....</a> </p>
